# Drupal LookingGlass Module

## Overview

LookingGlass is a user-friendly PHP based looking glass that allows the public (via a web interface) to execute network 
commands on behalf of your server.

This fork is a simple Drupal module wrapper for this project.

This is not to be confused with the Drupal Nagios Looking Glass Module. That is a completely unrelated project.

## To install:
* cd to /sites/all/modules/
* git clone
* Enable in Drupal Modules
* Create the Config.php file by running /sites/all/modules/LookingGlass/LookingGlass/configure.sh
* Browse to http://mydomain.com/LookingGlass
 
Only the minimum modifications required to get it to work as a Drupal module were done. There are no Drupal bells and whistles such as admin configuration and block functions.  Those things should be easy to add if you want to do that.
